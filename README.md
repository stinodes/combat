# COMBAT
### A DnD combat tracker app for desktop

Playing DnD with a digital character sheet and compendium is neat. But while playing,
I end up tracking my resources and character using Sticky Notes and NotePad.  
These are wildly flawed ways of tracking your countless resources and HP, usually resulting
in a lack of tracking eventually.  
  
With this app, I aim to replace my NotePad notes, and make tracking the character and glancing its 
stats and options easier (on the eyes).  
  
Personally, I build my characters using **[Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com/)**, so naturally the goal is to make use of its resources and character savefiles.

## Installation
There are no distribution packages **yet**. Pipelines to provide these will be added soon(tm).  
Building for all (non-mobile) platforms should be no issue, so expect that.  
For now, you can build from source, if you are a brave warrior.

## Technical
The app is made using the following technologies:

* **Electron** (I am a front-end developer after all)
* **React** (Library of choice)

### Requirements
To run the app **from source**, Node (16) and preferably Yarn are required.  

Clone the source code locally, install the dependencies (`$ yarn` or `$ yarn install`) and start the app by running `$ yarn start`.
