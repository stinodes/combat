# COMBAT
### A DnD combat tracker app for desktop

Playing DnD with a digital character sheet and compendium is neat. But while playing,
I end up tracking my resources and character using Sticky Notes and NotePad.  
These are wildly flawed ways of tracking your countless resources and HP, usually resulting
in a lack of tracking eventually.  
  
With this app, I aim to replace my NotePad notes, and make tracking the character and glancing its 
stats and options easier (on the eyes).  
  
Personally, I build my characters using **[Aurora Builder](https://aurorabuilder.com/)**, so naturally the goal is to make use of its resources and character savefiles.

## Installation
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/stinodes/combat/releases) page, and download the latest installer for your preferred platform.  
Once in the app, head over to resources or settings, depending on your version, and select your directory containing the Aurora resource-files.

## Technical
The app is made using the following technologies:

* **Electron** (I am a front-end developer after all)
* **React** (Library of choice)

### Requirements
To run the app **from source**, Node (16) and preferably Yarn are required.  

Clone the source code locally, install the dependencies (`$ yarn` or `$ yarn install`) and start the app by running `$ yarn start`.
